Write a very simple children story. The  goal of the story teaching the reader the language, so use simple words and useful words in the story

Write two versions of the story, one in English and one with pinyin, where pinyins frases are spit into arrays

Now put the story in two arrays, where each array consists of strings which is the segments of the stories. 

Also create a third array that consist of direkt translation of each of the pinyin words. The array should be two dimensional where the first dimension is the segments of the text and the second dimension is the translation of each of the pinyin words. The length of the translated array should be the same as the amount of words in pinyin so that i can map each of the pinyin words to its direkt translation. Just take the pinyin words one at a time and directly translate them

The array should be in python3 code

An example of this could be:

# English Story
english_story = [
    "Once upon a time, there was a little cat.",
    "The little cat liked to play.",
    "Every day, the little cat played with a red ball.",
    ...
]

# Pinyin Story
pinyin_story = [
    ["Cóngqián", "yǒu", "yī", "zhǐ", "xiǎo", "māo."],
    ["Xiǎo", "māo", "xǐhuān", "wán."],
    ...
]

# Direct Translation Array
translation_array = [
    ["once upon a time", "belonging to you", "one", "only; merely; just", "small; tiny; few; young", "cat"],
    ["small; tiny; few; young", "cat", "to like", "to play"],
    ...
]

Also, start give the story a name where the spaces are -
you dont need to write about animals, just write a good quite long story! 

Make sure the length of Pinyin Story strings are the same as the length of Direct Translation Array translations, so there is a one to one match
